This led to a proliferation of non-standard bespoke tools built and developed for the same company. This is no longer the case any more. The merging of development and operations called \"DevOps\" are now driving development of standardised hyperscale orchestration tools that can be leveraged and are accessible by individual developers or small teams.\r\n\r\nOrchestration encompasses the entire range of problems that DevOps practitioners tackle. This means there are many tools which do many different things, with many overlapping features.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to create a quality list of orchestration platforms with a collection of articles, blog posts, slides, and videos about them. After reading the linked articles, you should have a good idea about: the pros and cons of each tool, a basic understanding of how the tool works, and what each tool is trying to achieve. Basically, you should have all the information you need to decide which tool will best fit your needs. Do note that some of these tools are still under development, and the information on how it works will change rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe whole site is open source and is updated quite frequently.
